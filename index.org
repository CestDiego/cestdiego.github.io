I'm a Peruvian ex-physicist and developer living in New York interested in
programming, Linux desktop ricing, music, astronomy photography and AI. I tackle
on challenging problems and try to solve them with code, I also spend a high
amount of time using Emacs and contribute to Spacemacs in order to finish the
Editor Wars (Emacs + Vim = ❤). If you want to know more about me check out the
[[file:about][about]] page, also [[file:cv.pdf][here]] is my cv

They say I could do anything I wanted, so I became a quotable person. Here you
go.
