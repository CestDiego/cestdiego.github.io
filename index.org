I'm a Peruvian physics undergrad and developer interested in programming, linux
desktop theming, music, astronomy and AI. I tackle on challenging problems and
try to solve them with code, I also spend a high amount of time in Emacs. If you
want to know more about me check out the [[file:about][about]] page. If you want to glance my
cv, here you [[file:cv.pdf][go]].
