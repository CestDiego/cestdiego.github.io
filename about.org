I was born in one of Saturn's moons, maybe Pan or Pandora (Just kidding!). The
truth is that I was born in Comas, a Lima district whose humble beginnings were
a consequence of the so called “invasions” led by immigrants from the Peruvian
highlands. When I was a boy, Comas was still considered a Pueblo Jóven (a shanty
town surrounding Lima), but in spite of these atmosphere of poverty and
segregation, I always managed to travel to different worlds through my
imagination.
