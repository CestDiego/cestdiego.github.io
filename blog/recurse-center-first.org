#+DESCRIPTION: In which I break the news that I'm a Recurser now

So I'm pretty sure most of you know of the [[http://recurse.com][Recurse Center]], the awesome
programming community located in New York, well I'll be spending the next three
months there and I couldn't be more excited!

It'll surely be very challenging to move into such a big city such as NY coming
from Lima, PerÃº. Certainly finding a place to stay was as hard as I expected but
I got a lot of help from great friends.

I guess now I'll have to use this blog ever so often to try and show the world
what have I been doing during my stay at RC.

Happy Hacking!
