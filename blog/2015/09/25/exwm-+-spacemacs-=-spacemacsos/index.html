I've been using Spacemacs for a little less than a year now, and since then it
has only showed improvement because of the awesome community around it. Around
the same time I started to love using Window Managers instead of Desktop
Environments, and I'm sure that I'm not alone in saying that sometimes the
window manager that only mattered are the ones that let you spawn Emacs and have
it full screen without unneeded panels or borders or "unity dashboards" ugh. 
</p>

<p>
But then came the other features and goodies like Automatic Tiling (BSPWM, i3),
Tabbing (i3, StumpWM), Floating windows that can act as a scratchpad that you
can have quick acces to, all of these I have always looked for in WM,
configurability also is something to worry about, scripts for BSPWM, or the
choice of using i3bar or i3blocks for i3 which was nice, and also having a nice
panel that made heads turn when they saw your setup was something I always ended
up spending lots of time on, but in the end I would always just use windows in
full screen in my laptop even though I have decent screen realstate (1080p).
</p>

<p>
Having tried EXWM I feel that I really don't need a panel anymore, and what is
more awesome is that using Spacemacs with it makes it so simple to configure
because the somewhat hard stuff to make Emacs behave like a WM, like
window-management, resizing, fonts, mode-line with useful information, shells
that pop (using the <b>shell</b> layer), are already there. But not only that, but
new things which are even more awesome and are not seen in normal WMs are also
brought to the table: Org Agenda "native" integration (like the last post I
made. you don't need to spawn an emacsclient now :P), Window-purpose so that you
can use X windows instead of buffers for compilation, tree, live-view of your
project in a Chrome window connected to your Emacs with swankjs, etc.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that by now you are more or less convinced that EXWM rocks, you can try
it with your own Emacs configuration but if you are in Spacemacs, try the EXWM
layer. Instructions on how to use EXWM are pretty straight forward, I'm afraid I
can't help Ubuntu users as I'm pretty sure you'll need to create a session file
that links to a Desktop file that executes Emacs and have <code>(exwm-enable)</code>
somewhere in your Emacs configuration file. So I'm gonna be pretty straight
forward and just share what command I have on my initialization script.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh"><span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">~/.xinitrc</span>
<span class="org-keyword">exec</span> dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs --eval <span class="org-string">"(exwm-enable)"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You may wonder why do I have the last eval part to enable exwm, well it's
Spacemacs right? so people might want to try the layer and use more than one WM
while they get used to EXWM, it's ok. I used to use i3 and Unity too, and I
guess that's a normal part of adapting, so I want those users to still be able
to use other WM or DE of their choice without exwm giving trouble. The layer
configures everything exwm related but doesn't activate it until you call it
with this setting. Also I use dbus-launch so that when the user quits Emacs it
also quits the session, which is great. Want to log out? no need to define new
keybindings, <code>C-x C-c</code> (I know not very Spacemacs-y but you know: "Old habits,
they die hard")
</p>


<p>
Once you have the Spacemacs Layer up and running you will be able to move into
workspaces, move through windows by <code>Super-hjkl</code> Go to last workspace with
<code>Super-Tab</code>, undo/redo window layouts with <code>Super-u/U</code> and many things more, if
you want a detailed description check out the layer on Spacemacs. You'll find it
hard to use any other WM, in EXWM <b>windows</b> finally mean windows as we know
them.
</p>


<p>
There are some downsides though, given the not good concurrency in Emacs, when
an elisp action takes too much time it <b>will</b> freeze the system because there
are no threads whatsoever, so if you become very passionate about EXWM go ahead
and try to implement async in Emacs :P I think change in Emacs won't happen
unless people are really hyped in changing stuff. Also contribute back to EXWM
and XELB and report bugs @ch11nge has done a great work with EXWM and XELB and
he is a very responsive maintainer, I'm really impressed but how much work might
have gone into making these tools.
