** Lord of the Rings
My favorite scenes are (in this order)
1. The attack of the Rohirrim
2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
    + this was already my favorite scene in the book
    + I really like Miranda Otto.
3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
    - on DVD only
    He makes a really funny face when it happens.
But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
Important actors in this film are:
- Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
- Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
    him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.
