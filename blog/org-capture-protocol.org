Hello friend,

I know that you have heard about org, and how great it is. But then you started
trying it and you were overwhelmed at how many ways of customizing it to suit
your needs are there. Also you might find that you could switch your lifestyle
to plain text, but don't know where to start. That's why I think this could be a
first introduction post on how to use org-capture to manage your bookmarks,
remember you could store the org file into a file synchronizer of your choice
and have it also in your phone.

It'll look something like this:

 ** Disclaimer ** I'm no way an org-mode power user, and the advice here could
 be improved a lot, and that's why you can also make =constructive= comments :)

We take the desktop file from this [[http://www.chawdhary.co.uk/2012/07/04/xdg-org-protocol.html][blog post]] which explaining how we could use
org-protocol with a button in the bookmark bar. But I think we may be able to do better :) -psst, I'll give you a hint: we'll use a chrome extension-

#+begin_src conf
  # ~/.local/share/applications/emacs-capture.desktop or wherever it can be found
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=Emacs Client
  Exec=emacs-capture %u 
  Icon=emacs-icon
  Type=Application
  Terminal=false
  MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol;
#+end_src

You might find that we used =emacs-capture= instead of emacsclient, that's
because no matter how hard I tried I couldn't add the arguments I needed into the =.desktop= file, this is how the =emacs-capture= script looks like:

#+begin_src sh
  #!/bin/sh
  emacsclient -c -F "((name . \"emacs-capture\") (height . 10) (width . 80))" "$@"
#+end_src

You'll have to put it somewhere in your =PATH=, preferably =~/bin=? just double
check. The =-c= means we want a new frame (we want a pop-up after all) and the
=-F= flag just tells emacs to create the new frame with the frame-properties
defined in the alist given to it, the name property is special for reasons
you'll see later but it's specially important for us Tiling Window Manager
users, because we have to define which type of windows we want as =floating=. In
i3, this would look like this:

#+begin_src conf
  for_window [instance="emacs-capture"] floating enable
#+end_src

Let's jump in the Emacs part though, we have to set up org-protocol somehow,
this code will be enough:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-capture)
  (require 'org-protocol)

  ;;; Org Capture
  ;;;; Thank you random guy from StackOverflow
  ;;;; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23517372/hook-or-advice-when-aborting-org-capture-before-template-selection

  (defadvice org-capture
      (after make-full-window-frame activate)
    "Advise capture to be the only window when used as a popup"
    (if (equal "emacs-capture" (frame-parameter nil 'name))
        (delete-other-windows)))

  (defadvice org-capture-finalize
      (after delete-capture-frame activate)
    "Advise capture-finalize to close the frame"
    (if (equal "emacs-capture" (frame-parameter nil 'name))
        (delete-frame)))

  ;;; Capture Templates
  ;;;; Add idea, mind-onanism, contacts, movies to download das
  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(("l" "Temp Links from the interwebs" item
           (file+headline "links.org" "Temporary Links")
           "%?\nEntered on %U\n \%i\n %a")))
#+end_src

Remember that =emacs-capture= was part of the frame-properties? this is why, we
can advise the capture function to do certain stuff only in this popup frame
that we would not normally like when we use org-capture normally, like closing
the frame after it's done.

The Capture template could be improved, I'd suggest to anyone that wants to dive
into this type of integration to check out how to make cool templates, you can
even make it ask you for tags, and it will complete the tags you have there. :)

We have now achieved the emacs related part of this, congratz, m8!

Now we have to have something in our browser that allows us to bind
=Control+Shift+L= (or any key you may want, just modify the setting in
chrome://extensions). We'll use an extension that I made especially for this
case, as I didn't find another that worked, I'm planning on supporting
auto-detection of templates needed depending on the current web page, for
example if it's a YouTube video we are bookmarking it should maybe store more
stuff, even we could store the current time in the video or whatever :), the sky
is the limit when it comes to Emacs. However, I'm currently unable to pay the $5
needed to publish this app ( ;_;), so you'll just have to clone my repo (link at the
bottom) and upload it to the extensions manually in your browser.

I hope you find this useful, and if you have any suggestions, PRs are welcome at
https://github.com/CestDiego/org-capture-chrome. Leave a comment suggesting how
would you use org-capture as well â˜º. 

 ** UPDATE 1**

 So thanks to user */u/shackra* on [[http://emacs.reddit.com][/r/emacs]] I can share with you another use for
 non-chrome users, you'll need to have the Emacs lisp above, and also the
 =emacs-capture= script in your =PATH=.

 In your WM or Desktop Environment check how to run commands with key bindings,
 and bind any key you want (I'm using Super+Space here for i3) and then pass the
 extra argument =-e "(org-capture nil \"l\")" == where =l= in this case is the
 template I defined above, I have others (like =i= for jotting ideas)
 
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   ("i" "Jotting ideas fast" entry
    (file+headline "gtd.org" "Ideas")
    "* %?\n %i\n%t\n%A")
 #+end_src
 
#+begin_src conf
  bindsym $mod+space       exec emacs-capture --eval '(org-capture nil "l")'
  bindsym $mod+Shift+space exec emacs-capture --eval '(org-capture nil "i")'
#+end_src
 
And so you can have multiple key bindings to register many capture actions, go
nuts.
